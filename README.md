# flutter_practice

A new Flutter project.

This is a ramble project of mine where I will push anything and everything I think / write / read on Flutter + Dart. Mainly I will try to create separate file for each type of widget so I can just plug and play those easily. 
Might contain broken codes that I couldn't fix without my morning coffee.
